# Google Code Jam 2019 Solutions ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Python%203-orange) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/theXYZT/codejam-2019)

My **Python 3** solutions to [Google Code Jam 2019](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive/2019) problems. All solutions will solve all the test sets. The solutions are written to run successfully on the Code Jam platform, which includes the following libraries:

 * Python 3.5.3
 * Numpy 1.16.2
 * Scipy 1.2.1

Some solutions may be too slow in Python 3 and might return a "Time Limit Exceeded" error on the Code Jam platform. For these, I will try to provide a solution using PyPy 2 (which is faster in some cases) in the notes that should be able to successfully pass all test sets.
